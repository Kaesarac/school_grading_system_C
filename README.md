# school_grading_system_C
School grading system made entirely in C. No GUI was used in the entirety of it. My very first project for SENAI as Programming Logic Semester Test. I fell in love with C that day &lt;3

The code is largely in Brazilian Portuguese. If you run the .exe you will be able to use it with the help of a translator.

Maybe i'll translate it myself one of these days ðŸ˜œ
